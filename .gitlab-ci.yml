# This file is a template, and might need editing before it works on your project.
# An example .gitlab-ci.yml file to test (and optionally report the coverage
# results of) your [Julia][1] packages. Please refer to the [documentation][2]
# for more information about package development in Julia.
#
# Here, it is assumed that your Julia package is named `MyPackage`. Change it to
# whatever name you have given to your package.

# Below is the template to run your tests in Julia
.test_template: &test_definition
  # Uncomment below if you would like to run the tests on specific references
  # only, such as the branches `master`, `development`, etc.
  # only:
  #   - master
  #   - development
  script:
    # Let's run the tests. Substitute `coverage = false` below, if you do not
    # want coverage results.
    - /opt/julia/bin/julia -e 'Pkg.clone(pwd()); Pkg.test("DeformableRegistration",
      coverage = true)'
    # Comment out below if you do not want coverage results.
    - /opt/julia/bin/julia -e 'Pkg.add("Coverage"); cd(Pkg.dir("DeformableRegistration"));

# REMARK: Do not forget to enable the coverage feature for your project, if you
# are using code coverage reporting above. This can be done by
#
# - Navigating to the `CI/CD Pipelines` settings of your project,
# - Copying and pasting the default `Simplecov` regex example provided, i.e.,
#   `\(\d+.\d+\%\) covered` in the `test coverage parsing` textfield.

# WARNING: This template is using the `julialang/julia` images from [Docker
# Hub][3]. One can use custom Julia images and/or the official ones found
# in the same place. However, care must be taken to correctly locate the binary
# file (`/opt/julia/bin/julia` above), which is usually given on the image's
# description page.
